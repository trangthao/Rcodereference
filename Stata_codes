gen str7 ctyyear=country_code+yearcode \\joining country code and year to get AGO1950, AGO1951, and so on
gen str2 yr=substr(yearcode,3,2) \\The first term in parentheses is the string variable that you are extracting from, the second is the position of the first character you
                                  \\want to extract (--X-), and the third term is the number of characters to be extracted (--XX)

gen str10 country=substr(code,1,strpos(code," ")-1) \\ The strpos() function gives the position of the second argument in the first argument, so here it tells you what position the

gen str10 city=trim(substr(code, strpos(code," "),11)) \\The trim() function removes any leading or trailing blanks. So, the city substring extracts from the code variable, starting at the blank
